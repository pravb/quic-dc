                    draft-montenegro-quic-dc-latest

Abstract

   QUIC is a general-purpose transport for the Internet.  This document
   defines extensions to make QUIC more amenable to datacenter
   environments by allowing packet number encryption to be optionally
   disabled.

1.  Introduction

   QUIC is a new transport for the internet.  In its generality, there
   are features which are not well suited for datacenter environments.
   In particular, QUIC uses Packet Number Encryption (PNE).  This
   document defines a negotiation using transport parameters to disable
   PNE.  Internet facing nodes should not disable PNE, so browsers, for
   example, should not implement this extension.  On the other hand,
   properly configured nodes within a datacenter could turn off PNE in
   their exchanges to avoid the CPU cost that PNE implies.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
