# Introduction

QUIC is a new transport for the internet. In its generality, there are features which are not well suited
for datacenter environments. In particular, QUIC uses Packet Number Protection (PNP)
to prevent ossification and to provide unlinkability upon (voluntary) migration.
However, there are constrained environments where these are not a concern, in particular,
connections within a datacenter.

This document defines
a negotiation mechanims using transport parameters to disable PNP. Internet facing nodes MUST not disable PNP, so
browsers, for example, should not implement this extension. On the other hand, configured nodes
within a datacenter could turn off PNP in their exchanges to avoid the CPU cost that PNP implies.

# Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Transport Parameter to Disable Packet Number Protection

This document defines a new transport parameter for QUIC {{QUIC-TRANSPORT}}:

disable_packet_number_protection (0x000c ?, value TBD):

: The endpoint is disabling packet number protection as specified in {{QUIC-TLS}}.
  This parameter is a zero-length value. This parameter only affects short headers.

A successful negotiation of the "disable_packet_number_protection" parameter
requires both peers to send this transport parameter.

Peers that have successfully negotiated the "disable_packet_number_protection" parameter MUST NOT use packet number protection on short header packets.


# Security Considerations

Per section 6.11.5 of {{QUIC-TLS}}, PNP is a partial mitigation against linkability and to prevent ossification.
The "disable_packet_number_protection" parameter should be negotiated in environments in which these are not
a concern.

# IANA Considerations

Per section 13.1 of {{QUIC-TLS}}, this document requests IANA assign a value for the new transport parameter
and record it in the registry for "QUIC Transport Parameters" under the "QUIC Protocol" heading.
IANA is further requested to assign a value with the first byte in the range 0x00 to 0xfe (in
hexadecimal) as follows:


| Value  | Parameter Name                   | Specification                       |
|:-------|:---------------------------------|:------------------------------------|
| 0x000c | disable_packet_number_protection | This document                       |
